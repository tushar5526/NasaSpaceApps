**Considerations**


- Your solution may show users where current and/or historical activities related to space are in an area. If you include historical activities, how can you include points of interest in your project?
- How can your solution become more of an educational tool? Consider providing links and information about the nature of the work and the groups and organizations performing it.
- Remember that the “space sector” also includes entities using space-borne platforms to do research about the Earth.
- In addition to the resources provided, consider searching space news sites for information on international partnerships, government activities, commercial activities in space exploration, and U.S. state-specific Space Grant Consortiums.
